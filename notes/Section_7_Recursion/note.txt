Recursion:
A process (a function) that calls itself (should have an end point)

### How recursive functions work
Invoke the same function with a different input until reaching base.

### Base case
The condition when the recursion ends

### Different Input
So we can reach base case at some moments in the future


### Pitfalls:
no base case
forget to return or return the wrong thing
stack overflow

### Pure Recursion Tips (no help function)
For arrays, use methods like slice, the spread operator, and concat that make copies of arrays so you do not mutate them
